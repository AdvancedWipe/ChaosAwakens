			"text": "The Termite is a unique little creature. Long considered a relative of the ants, Termites carry along with them an energy. But this energy is slightly corrupted. In contrast to the other ants, interacting with this creature will take you to a place where the beautiful overworld has changed into a crystalline confusion. The termites also have a tendency to eat wooden blocks and bite at its’ humans. So don’t mess with it too long, unless you want some termite bites. "
