			"text": "The bulkiest of the Robo-Tribe, the Robo-Pounder has been built and coded in a specific way to pound (punch) mobs within their range so hard that they go flying from their punch. Robo-Pounders are so bulky that they break villager homes and weaker blocks. Due to conflicting ties in their programming, Robo-Pounders will attack villagers and iron golems that are within their range."
