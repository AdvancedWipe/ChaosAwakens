			"text": "An ancient like creature made of wood, stones, and podzol, The Spruce Ent is a massive creature that stands taller than most mobs in the world, as well as bulkier and stronger than most. Unlike the other Ents, The Spruce Ent, while angry occasionally enjoys the scents of the Taiga it lives in. Must be the sweet berries. Weâ€™ve tried to talk to the ent personally, but every time we tried, our reporters were smacked across the world. So, feel free to speculate."
