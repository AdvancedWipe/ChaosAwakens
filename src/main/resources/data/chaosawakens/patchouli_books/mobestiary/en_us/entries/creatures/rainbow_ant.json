			"text": "The Rainbow Ant is a prideful little creature. It spreads happiness and care whenever it walks. It may be one of the happiest mobs in Chaos Awakens. Due to its’ happy nature, The Rainbow Ants contain an energy to teleport those who interact to a place where trading goes a long way, and robotics are a natural predator. Rainbow ants do not harm other mobs, instead you can watch them crawl happily!"
