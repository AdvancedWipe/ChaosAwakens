			"text": "It appears some carrot pigs had indulged themselves too much on an exclusive food. As certain groups of carrot pigs ate too much gold, they transformed into Golden Cannot Pigs. Some say these golden carrot pigs have a “see all, heal all” vision. I wonder what that means. They also make great companions! You can saddle and ride them on your adventures!"
