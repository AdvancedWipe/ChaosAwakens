			"text": "An ancient creature of horrific rage and a corrupted, warped mind, The Warped Ent is a massive creature that holds his ground in the rough world of the Nether. Warped Ents are powered by the rough, magical essence from the Warped Stem, the insanity of the Warped Fungus, and the strength of the Shroomlight. Despite their strength, Warped Ents actually tend to be a lot more philosophical than any other Ents."
