			"text": "It appears some pigs had indulged themselves too much on one specific food. As certain groups of pigs ate way too many carrots. They transformed into Carrot Pigs, adorable new beings that wander the plains of the world! Some say carrot pigs have a “see all” vision. I wonder what that means. They also make great companions! You can saddle and ride them on your adventures!"
